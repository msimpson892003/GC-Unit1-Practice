        <p>
            I was born in a log cabin with only a candle, a bed and a Commodore 64 to my name. 
            Times were tough and the winters were harsh, but the thought of one day getting no compile errors in my code kept me going. 
            Eventually, I came out with something that I could call my own son. His first words were "Hello, world." 
            He was basic (which made sense, since he was written in BASIC), but he was my child and 
            I loved him like Marvel loved churning out superhero movies every 4.5 seconds.

            I was interested in Grand Circus because of its grandness and circus-like nature. The grandest of the grand, the 
            most circus-y of all the circuses. Oh, and I heard they do something with coding as well. That sounds like fun.
